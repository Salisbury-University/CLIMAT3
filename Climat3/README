All Javascript is the work of Dylan Williams, including the setup of Firestore and Firebase
The HTML and design aspect are the work of Vincent Fealy



- The .firebase folder is used for setting up the firebase for deployment and using the cloud firestore database. Shouldn't need to be touched

- The dist folder is currently the default path for when you run 'npm run build' to create a new package for the javascript. 
    main.js will be created in this folder, as well as a license text, and to see changes on the website, it will need to be moved
    to /public/js, overwriting the old one. it is compiled with webpack due to the modular nature of the library imports

- The node_modules folder is where the npm libraries are held, such as webpack. should not need to be touched

- The public folder is what is deployed to the website when you run 'firebase deploy', and what is shown when you run 'http-server -c-1'
    on your local host (or just start a live server, however you wish to do this). there are the images needed for the website, the html for the various pages, and all the css and js required

- The src folder is the javascript that is compiled with 'npm run build'. When making changes to the user defined javascript of the application (largely those interacting with the database), this command will need to be ran. See comments on the dist folder. This folder consists of two main functioanlity, which is displaying the cards on the website with data from the database, and downloading the selected articles into a XML RDF file to import into Zotero.

- Other files that are lose in the CLIMAT3 folder that shouldn't be touched include
    - database.rules.json - for use with cloud firestore database
    - firebase.json - for use with firebase (f you dont have this, it can be found on the firebase console, ask Karl Maier for login)
    - .firebasesrc - same used for firebase
    - package-lock.json - for use with npm
    - package.json - also for use with npm

Web Development By: Vincent Fealy
- There is always more to expand on, for this project we wanted to start by making the website really
    simple and straight to the point. The website has all the necessary features that Dr. Maier wanted, although there could be things added to make the website more in depth. Looking towards the future of the website more interactive features to attract people that dont know anything about the BioPsychoSocial framework, so they can explore the website and continue using it. In hopes that the project as a whole gets expanded to more categories.

Web Dev Features
- counter to show the amount of artcles stored in each category
- Logo that might better fit the framework
- user login/admin, this feature was beyond our scope of the project but could be possible in the future
- JavaScript to show a visual picture on each card signifying its classification
