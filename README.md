This Github will be used for the development purposes of our project, created by
Dylan Williams, Olivia Brague, Vincent Fealy, Rafiedul Islam, and Rachel Prusacki

This project has three major portions, seperated by the three folders found in this directory. This includes
    - The Executable, which allows us to scrape data off two predetermined websites
    - The website, which is where our data in our database is stored and displayed
    - The larger website, which was developed by Rachel as a landing page for all things TIEI

For more information on each individual part, see the README in each folder.
